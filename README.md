# 🛍️ Cycle Shop Mock – E-commerce Webshop (React + Vite + TypeScript + Node.js)

This project is a mock webshop for a fictional bicycle store. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with both modern frontend and backend technologies, and to build a scalable, full-stack e-commerce application.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React** – Component-based frontend library
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed JavaScript for better reliability and development experience
- **Vite** – Fast development environment and build tool
- **SASS (SCSS)** – Advanced styling with nesting and variables
- **Redux Toolkit** – Centralized state management with minimal boilerplate
- **React-Redux** – Bindings between Redux and React components
- **React Router DOM** – Client-side routing between pages

### Backend

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime environment for the backend
- **Express.js** – Minimalist web framework for building APIs
- **RESTful API** – Custom API endpoints to serve product and category data

### Database

- **SupaBase** – Used to store product and category data persistently

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project started as a frontend-only exercise and has evolved into a full-stack application. It serves as a learning platform for:

- Building a scalable React frontend
- Managing global state with Redux Toolkit
- Creating and connecting a backend with Express.js
- Storing and retrieving data from a database
- Structuring full-stack applications using modern best practices

🛠️ Built as a learning project  
📦 Still in development – not intended for production use
